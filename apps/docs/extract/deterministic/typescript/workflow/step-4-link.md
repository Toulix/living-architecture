## What Gets Linked

- **Internal calls**: UseCase → DomainOp, API → UseCase
- **HTTP calls**: Service → external API
- **Event flows**: EventHandler → Event subscriptions
- **UI navigation**: Page → API calls

## Output

Updates `.riviere/graph.json` with links between components.

Creates `.riviere/step-4-checklist.md` tracking linking progress.

## Next Step

After linking components, proceed to:
